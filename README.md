# 👋 Hi, I'm Ntando Mazibuko

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I enjoy building interactive, creative, and technically challenging projects — from web demos to full Unity games 🎮.  
Here you'll find a mix of front-end work, backend experiments, and 3D environments where I explore new ideas and improve my craft.
